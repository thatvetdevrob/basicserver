# Lab 04b: RWD Portfolio

## Overview

This is my profile based on HTML5 UP Prologue.

## Resources

- [HTML5 UP templates](https://html5up.net/)


### Time Estimate

For each of the features listed below, make an estimate of the time it will take you to complete the feature, and record your start and finish times for that feature:

## Feature 1: organize the styles in to correct SMACC structure

```
Number and name of feature: 1 Smaccs styles

Estimate of time needed to complete: It took a couple hours: i needed to 
make sure the styles were not over written, repeated, and when new ones were added and
to consider the best place to place them.

Start time: Thursday

Finish time: Friday

Actual time needed to complete: more than a couple hours split over two days.
```

## Feature 2: organize the content

```
Number and name of feature: Organize the content

Estimate of time needed to complete: days

Start time: Saturday

Finish time: Monday morning but still not complete

Actual time needed to complete: I think this is anongoing process as it needs to account for 401 project to 
build the portolio.
```

Add this information to your README.

### Feature #1: Refactor the CSS 

#### Why are we implementing this feature?

- As a user, I want the portfolio to have a clean UI so that it is visually appealing.

#### What are we going to implement?

Given that a user opens the application in the browser  
When the user navigates to the home page  
Then the portfolio contents should be displayed  

#### How are we implementing it?

- Refactor the `main.css` file using SMACSS principles.
  - You may decide how many files to include, but at the minimum should include  `base.css`, `layout.css`, and `modules.css`. However, think through the way you separate your CSS rules. For example, you may want several CSS files in a `modules` folder, if you feel that the code needs to be organized in that manner.

### Feature #2: Modify the contents

#### Why are we implementing this feature?

- As a user, I want to view a unique portfolio so that the skills and personality of the developer are portrayed.

#### What are we going to implement?

Given that a user opens the application in the browser  
When the user navigates to the home page  
Then the content should be unique and reflect the skills and personality of the developer  

#### How are we implementing it?

- Modify the contents of the template to make it your own. The HTML elements may remain the same if you like, but the content should be adapted to reflect your personal details and skills.
- Apply the following changes, some of which were part of your prework for this course:
  - Next to the header image, add your name and a short, 2-3 word title.
  - In the Intro section, add a personal headline. This should be the same as or similar to your headline on your LinkedIn profile.
  - In the Portfolio section, state what you are excited about in tech. Add links to projects and include placeholders for future 301 and 401 projects. If you would like, you can add links to sites such as LinkedIn and GitHub here, or social sites.
  - In the About Me section, add your personal pitch and banner photo. 
- Add you own color scheme and Google fonts.
- Change the content and images to reflect your personal preferences. If you are using online images, make sure they are licensed for free, commercial use. For example, [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) has a nice variety of free images. 
- Update the list of social media icons with your links using icons for your favorite social media sites from IcoMoon or Font Awesome.
- Keep in mind that this template is just a starting point. It is yours to modify to reflect your personal online presence as a software developer so have fun and be creative!
